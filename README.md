# Parking Spot - Smart Parking System

This repository contains a **Software Engineering project** developed as part of academic coursework.  
The project focuses on solving urban parking problems by providing users with an application to manage parking efficiently and securely.

## Features
- Find available parking spaces in crowded areas  
- Avoid fines due to illegal parking  
- Calculate parking charges based on duration  
- Locate vehicles in large parking areas to save time  
- Anti-theft feature for improved vehicle security  

## Contents
- **Frontend**: Multiple HTML pages (login, signup, reserve, search, track, anti-theft, admin dashboard)  
- **Design Assets**: CSS and images for styling and layout  
- **Documentation**:  
  - `Parking-Spot.pdf` – Complete documentation including requirements & diagrams  
  - `Parking-Spot.pptx` – Presentation slides  

## Deliverables
- Project Report (PDF)  
- Project Presentation (PPTX)  
- Frontend Prototype (HTML/CSS/Static UI)  

## Purpose
The goal of this project was to design and partially implement a **Smart Parking System**.  
It combines **requirements engineering, system design (UML, use cases, DFD)**, and a functional **frontend prototype** to demonstrate how urban parking challenges can be addressed.
